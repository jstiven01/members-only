# Project 2: Members Only!
This project is about building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. You can check the complete description [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication#project-2-members-only)

## Built With:
ruby 2.6.3, rails 5.2.3

## Author
Johan Tinjaca https://github.com/jstiven01

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
